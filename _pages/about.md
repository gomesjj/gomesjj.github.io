My name is Jose Gomes. I am an IT Architect, originally from Brazil, but living in the United Kingdom for the last 26 years. I love motorbikes, classic cars, computers, wine, beer (real ale), reading, good drama and most anything techie.

To pay the bills, I specialise in the provisioning of infrastructure solutions, and have detailed experience in the IT Services Support, Banking, Government and Telecommunications sectors. I have extensive experience in the design, validation and build of technical solutions, particularly in the area of virtualisation (both Wintel and UNIX).

With the bills paid, I spend some of my spare time trying to keep up with new technologies. One cannot be a good Architect without proper hands-on experience, methinks<sup>[1](#footie1)</sup>. 

Thanks for checking out my blog!
