Intel Active Management Technology is one of the hardware technologies (perhaps the most recognised and representative) that is part of Intel's [vPro](http://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/architecture-and-technology/vpro/vpro-technology-general.html) offerings. AMT offers the benefits of out-of-band management similar to IPMI, but for personal computers as opposed to servers.

*[IPMI]: Intelligent Platform Management Interface

When I was selecting the NUC model(s) to use for my ESXi home lab, the fact that both the [DC53427HYEA](http://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/nuc/nuc-kit-dc53427hye-board-d53427rke.html) and the [NUC5i5RYH](http://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/nuc/nuc-kit-nuc5i5ryh.html) sported processors with vPro and AMT support helped me sway towards them. The NUCs were replacing kit that had full IPMI functionality, and I knew how much I would miss the convenience of managing the new "servers" remotely. 

There was a little fly in the ointment though. As I researched the technology it became clear that all the management tools were Windows only. Even Linux support was almost non-existent except for some example code distributed with the AMT SDK. Bummer, I thought to myself, another "Macs need not apply" zone.

I do run a Windows 7 VM on my laptop solely because of Visio (another bummer), so I resigned to the fact that the VM would just have to spin a few more times a week. That is, until I came across [Mesh Commander](http://www.meshcommander.com/meshcommander). Mesh Commander is open source software developed by Intel's Ylian Saint-Hilaire, which is distributed as a WIN64 binary or as a website served from IIS (Yuck!). Since the IIS version included the source code, I decided to download it and see if I could coerce the code to run on Apache or something else. To my surprise, in the bowels of the source code, I found an NW.js folder. That was more like it!

*[IIS]: Internet Information Services

I dabble from time to time with some coding and scripting, particularly when I want to have some piece of software running on Mac OS X; but, I had never played with NW.js (née node-webkit). If you are not familiar with NW.js, you can see what it is all about [here](http://nwjs.io).

To start with, I downloaded version 0.1.3 of Mesh Commander (it's now at 0.2.0) and version 0.12.3 of NW.js (stable is 0.14.5 now). I must confess I had much more problems with the code than I expected, but I think it was down to NW.js. Since then I have tested with later versions and the total amount of changes to the source code is now insignificant, amounting to just a couple of Mac OS X specific GUI items.

So, lets move on to the recipe.

### The Ingredients

1\. Apple Developer ID

You will need a valid Developer ID and signing certificate, otherwise the resulting application will not even run. The Mac Developer Program costs GBP 79 / USD 99 per year for an individual.

[Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)

{: .notice--info}
Have you had enough already and don't want to bake anymore? You can download one that I prepared earlier, fully signed, [here](https://bintray.com/gomesjj/APPS/download_file?file_path=OSX%2FMeshCommander.dmg.zip).

2\. Xcode

If you haven't installed Xcode yet, get it from the App Store, or download from [ Developer](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/). 

Time for a cuppa of whatever rocks your boat, as it will take some time...

3\. Install ```node```:

The easiest way is by installing Homebrew first

```sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Now, you could just install ```node``` and ```npm``` straight away, but I recommend you follow the instructions in this [post](https://johnpapa.net/how-to-use-npm-global-without-sudo-on-osx/) by John Papa. The instructions show how to use ```npm global``` without the need for ```sudo```.

***or***

If you don't mind running code compiled by someone else, just install the ```node``` binary, which also includes ```npm```. Download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

4\. Install ```nw-builder```:

```sh
npm install -g nw-builder
```
I have used both ```nw-builder``` and ```nwjs-macappstore-builder```. Whilst both of them work well, I prefer ```nw-builder``` as it offers more control.

If you would rather decide for yourself, have a look at [nw-builder](https://github.com/nwjs/nw-builder) and [nwjs-macappstore-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nwjs-macappstore-builder).

5\. Grab the modified source files and other requisites from my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/gomesjj/MeshCommander)


### Lets bake it

1\. Create a directory to store the files and the built application.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/devel
``` 

If you downloaded the contents of my repository, just copy them over to the above created folder. You can also clone the contents directly with ``git``

```sh
cd ~/devel
git clone https://github.com/gomesjj/MeshCommander.git
```
You should end-up with something like this

```sh
ls
MeshCommander/

ls -lR MeshCommander

```
2\. Build the application

```sh
cd MeshCommander
. ./mkapp
```
If the build is successful you should see output similar to this:

```
node:61321) fs: re-evaluating native module sources is not supported. If you are using the graceful-fs module, please update it to a more recent version.
